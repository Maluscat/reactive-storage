# ReactiveStorage
Register, observe and intercept deeply reactive data on any object without the
need for
[proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)!


```js
const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  depth: Infinity,
  setter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) }
});
storage.register('foo');

storage.target.foo = {
  bar: 3,
  baz: [ 'a', 'b' ]
};
// SET foo: { ... }
// SET foo.bar: 3
// SET foo.baz: [ ... ]
// SET foo.baz.0: "a"
// SET foo.baz.1: "a"

storage.target.foo.bar++;
// SET foo.bar: 4

storage.target.foo.baz[1] = 'lor';
// SET foo.baz.1: "lor"
```


## Rationale
[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
are dope and allow for full reactivity, but they come with a significant
performance overhead. Even though JS is very fast nowadays, property accesses
add up quickly as they are used constantly and everywhere. Sure,
ReactiveStorage is somewhat limited when compared to proxies, but it can be
very powerful when used in the right spots!

I've also seen some sources claim deep reactivity to be impossible without using
proxies. Even Vue
[didn't support it](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#For-Arrays)
before making the switch to proxies. Take that!


## Limitations
ReactiveStorage is explicitly not a catch-all solution for reactivity. Since it
purely relies on
[Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty),
it inherits all of its limitations too. These largely amount to:
- No dynamic approach; Data must be explicitly registered in order to become
  reactive.
- Only getters and setters; The data cannot be modified in-place using methods
  like `array.push(...)` or `array.splice(...)`.


## Installation
Since this library is completely runtime agnostic, it can be used inside any
JavaScript environment, including the web. The work on the library is mostly
finished, so there won't be many more updates in the future.

### Download
The only required file is `ReactiveStorage.js` inside the [`script`](./script)
folder. If you want type checking, fetch `ReactiveStorage.d.ts` as well!

### npm
Available on npm under `@maluscat/reactive-storage`. Use your favorite package
manager (or use it with Deno):
```sh
yarn add @maluscat/reactive-storage
bun install @maluscat/reactive-storage
npm install @maluscat/reactive-storage
```


## Concepts
A reactive property is defined via `Object.defineProperty` with attached
getters/setters. Properties are defined on a target object and store their
actual values at an arbitrary place, the endpoint.  In this library, the
endpoint is always an object, and a property's values are stored under the
property name within that endpoint (see below).

> [!note]
> In most of this document, "object" refers to *any* JavaScript object,
> be it an object literal, an array, a class instance, etc.

Let's say we register a reactive property "foo". The data flows like this:
```1c
# "foo" on target = {}

target.foo <-[GET]-- endpoint.foo
target.foo --[SET]-> endpoint.foo
```

Arrays work analogously since they are just objects with special syntax:
```1c
# "0" on target = []

target[0] <-[GET]-- endpoint[0]
target[0] --[SET]-> endpoint[0]
```

Deep reactivity is a recursive registration of object values to make their
children reactive as well. The properties of each distinct object are registered
into a new target object which their respective parents point to:
```1c
# "foo = { bar: 3, baz: 4 }" on target = {}
# implicit: target1 = {} with { GET/SET bar, GET/SET baz }

target.foo <-[GET]-- target1
target.foo --[SET]-> endpoint.foo

target1.bar <-[GET]-- endpoint.foo.bar
target1.bar --[SET]-> endpoint.foo.bar

target1.baz <-[GET]-- endpoint.foo.baz
target1.baz --[SET]-> endpoint.foo.baz
```

Looking only at the getters makes it a bit clearer:
```1c
# "foo = { bar: 3, baz: { lor: 10 } }" on target = {}
# implicit: target1 = {} with { GET/SET bar, GET/SET baz }
# implicit: target2 = {} with { GET/SET lor }

target.foo <-[GET]-- target1
target1.bar <-[GET]-- endpoint.foo.bar
target1.baz <-[GET]-- target2
target2.lor <-[GET]-- endpoint.foo.baz.lor
```


## Usage
The only non-typing exports are `ReactiveStorage`, `Filter` (also exposed via
`ReactiveStorage.Filter`) and, if needed, `ReactiveStorageError`:
```js
import { ReactiveStorage, Filter, ReactiveStorageError } from '@maluscat/reactive-storage';
```
See the [docs](#docs) for an overview of all additional typing related exports
for use in TypeScript.

ReactiveStorage can make objects deeply reactive such that any change within
arbitrarily deeply nested properties can be caught and intercepted. *Any* object
can be registered â€“ though by default this is only the case for arrays and
object literals to avoid infinite recursion and unwanted overhead
(can be controlled with the `depthFilter` [config](#configuration) option).

### Instanced vs. static approach
There are two ways to use this library: Using a `ReactiveStorage` instance or
using static methods.

An instance always holds a single immutable [configuration](#configuration)
which is passed in the constructor and used every time a property is registered.
The static methods take the configuration on a per-registration basis as an
additional argument.

A shallow copy of the used configuration with default values is stored in the
`config` instance property which can be used to access several implicit values,
such as the target if not explicitly passed. The target and endpoint are
additionally exposed via the `target` and `endpoint` properties respectively for
convenience.

```js
import { ReactiveStorage, Filter } from './ReactiveStorage.js';

const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  target: {},
  endpoint: {},
  enumerable: true,
  depth: 0,
  depthFilter: Filter.objectLiteralOrArray,
  getter: undefined,
  setter: undefined,
  postSetter: undefined,
});
```

### Registering properties
The `register(...)` method is used to register one or multiple properties,
optionally with an initial value. When using a `depth` configuration, any value,
so either the initial value or values assigned at any later point in time, will
be recursively traversed and registered until the given depth as long as it
matches the `depthFilter` (only object literals and arrays by default).

#### Instance
The instance method uses the instance's [configuration](#configuration) and
returns itself, to allow for chaining.
```ts
register(
  key: number | string | symbol,
  initialValue?: any
): ReactiveStorage
```

#### Static
The static method optionally takes a [configuration](#configuration) and returns
a shallow copy of the final configuration with default and implicit values.
```ts
register(
  key: number | string | symbol,
  initialValue?: any,
  options: RegistrationOptions = {}
): TODO
```

`registerRecursive(...)` is a helper function that extends `register` with
infinitely deep recursion (same as `depth: Infinity` in the deepest `depth`).
```ts
registerRecursive(
  key: number | string | symbol,
  initialValue?: any,
  options?: RegistrationOptions = {}
): TODO
```

### Configuring deep values
The `depth` config option accepts either a number or a configuration. If given a
*number*, this will be the max depth until which assigned values will be made
reactive. In this case, a layer's configuration will be inherited from the
parent config, with the exception of the `target` and `endpoint` options.

A given *configuration* will define options for that specific layer, which is
useful to specify individual getters/setters for each layer of depth. The
`target` option may not be specified since it will change with each new
assignment while other missing options except `endpoint` will be inherited from
its parent. This setup can be nested infinitely deep. To mitigate needing to do
this extensively, you can also make use of the getter/setter `path` argument
(specifically, its length). [TODO link]

In this example, three explicit reactivity layers are defined, each of which
defining an individual setter while inheriting the topmost getter. Layer 2
defines one additional implicit layer that will inherit its setter. Any layers
below that won't be reactive. Note how the `path` argument of the first two
setters always has the same length since they are not inherited downwards:
```ts
const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  depth: {
    depth: {
      setter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`Layer 2 or 3 SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) },
      depth: 1
    }
    setter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`Layer 1 SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) },
  },
  setter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`Layer 0 SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) },
  getter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`GET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) },
});

storage.register('foo', { bar: 3 });
// Layer 0 SET foo: { bar: 3 }
// Layer 1 SET foo.bar: 3

storage.target.foo = { bar: { baz: { lor: { val: 9 } } } }
// Layer 0      SET foo: { bar: ... }
// Layer 1      SET foo.bar: { baz: ... }
// Layer 2 or 3 SET foo.bar.baz: { lor: ... }
// Layer 2 or 3 SET foo.bar.baz.lor: { val: 9 }
/// <Layer 4 and downwards is not reactive>
```


### Initial assignment
The initial assignment will already call the specified `setter` and
`postSetter`. This can be filtered using the callback functions' `initial`
parameter.
```js
const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  depth: Infinity,
  setter: ({ val, initial, path }) => {
    console.log(`${initial ? 'initial' : ''} SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val)
  },
  postSetter: ({ val, initial, path }) => {
    console.log(`${initial ? 'initial' : ''} POST-SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val)
  }
});

storage.register('foo', {
  bar: [ 10, 20 ],
  baz: {
    lor: 'my-string'
  }
});
// initial      SET foo: { bar: ..., baz: ... }
// initial      SET foo.bar: [ 10 ]
// initial      SET foo.bar.0: 10
// initial POST-SET foo.bar.0: 10
// initial POST-SET foo.bar: [ 10 ]
// initial      SET foo.baz: { lor: ... }
// initial      SET foo.baz.lor: "my-string"
// initial POST-SET foo.baz.lor: "my-string"
// initial POST-SET foo.baz: { lor: ... }
// initial POST-SET foo: { bar: ..., baz: ... }

storage.target.foo = 3;
//      SET foo: 3
// POST-SET foo: 3
```

### Reactivity is kept alive
The initial registration [configuration](#configuration) is always kept alive,
meaning that reassigning a value will register it with the configuration used in
its initial registration. This also means that providing an initial value is
optional â€“ If omitted, an initial setter call will not be invoked (same with
explicitly passing `undefined`).
```js
const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  depth: Infinity,
  setter: ({ val, path }) => { console.log(`SET ${path.join('.')}:`, val) },
});

storage.register('foo');

storage.target.foo = 3;
// SET foo: 3

storage.target.foo = [ { lor: 69 }, 'bar', 'baz' ];
// SET foo: [ ... ]
// SET foo.0: { foo: 69 }
// SET foo.0.lor: 69
// SET foo.1: "bar"
// SET foo.2: "baz"
```

### Intercepting values
By default, a configured **setter** is a passive observer, so after being called,
the passed value will automatically be set to the property's respective
endpoint. However, a setter may return `true` to prevent the value from being
set. In addition to just dropping a value like this, a modified/custom value
can be assigned instead using the passed default setter `set`.

A **getter** analogously only observes the fetched values passively by default,
being given the value of the underlying endpoint when a property is fetched.
Any return value other than a nullish value (`null` or `undefined`) will yield
this value to the caller.

In this example, any assigned value that isn't a number will be discarded, while
numbers will always be clamped to the range [0, 100]. When fetched, they will be
rounded to the nearest 5:
```ts
const storage = new ReactiveStorage({
  depth: Infinity,
  getter: ({ val }) => {
    return Math.round(val / 5) * 5;
  },
  setter: ({ val, set }) => {
    if (typeof val !== 'number') return true;
    if (val > 100) {
      set(100);
      return true;
    } else if (val < 0) {
      set(0);
      return true;
    }
  },
});
storage.register('foo', 38);
console.log(storage.endpoint.foo) // 38
console.log(storage.target.foo) // 40

storage.target.foo = -6;
console.log(storage.endpoint.foo) // 0
console.log(storage.target.foo) // 0

storage.target.foo = 52;
console.log(storage.endpoint.foo) // 52
console.log(storage.target.foo) // 50

storage.target.foo = 'bar'
console.log(storage.endpoint.foo) // 52
console.log(storage.target.foo) // 50
```

### Instance helper functions
The `has(...)` instance method returns true if the given property key exists on
the instance's `target` and has thus been registered, false otherwise.
```ts
has(key: number | string | symbol): boolean
```

The `delete(...)` instance method deletes a registered property from the
instance's `target` and `endpoint`. Returns true if a property was successfully
deleted (speak, if the property had been registered), false otherwise.

Deep properties will not be deleted because the class does not hold a reference
to them. As such, they will be garbage collected instead.
```ts
delete(key: number | string | symbol): boolean
```

### About types



## Configuration
The configuration can either be passed to the constructor or to the static
methods. See here a summarized version of its interface with the full one
available at the [docs](#docs) (along with more examples). All fields are
optional.

### `target`
- Default: `{}`

The access point for the registered property/properties. Values are deposited at
the [endpoint](#endpoint). Can be *any* object, so it may also be an array, a
class instance, etc.

This property may only be defined in the topmost level of a configuration and
not within [`depth`](#depth) since these change on each assignment.

### `endpoint`
- Default: `{}`

The object that holds the actual data of registered properties.
The configured setter and getter will deposit the value to and fetch the
value from this endpoint respectively.

Can be accessed directly to bypass all specified setters and getters. In a
classic use case, it can be a good idea to use the endpoint for internal use,
while the setters/getters on the target do some extra work when accessed by a
user.

### `enumerable`
- Default: `true`

Whether registered properties should be enumerable inside the [target](#target).
Corresponds to the
[`Object.defineProperty` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty#enumerable)
of the same name.

### `depth`
- Default: `0`
- See also [Configuring deep values](#configuring-deep-values)

Whether and how keys inside object values should be registered such that they go
through additional layers of getters and setters. If a value is reassigned, it
is re-registered with the same configuration until the configured depth.

**If given a configuration**, the registered property will assume these options
in its layer. Can be nested infinitely deep.

**If given a number**, keys will be registered recursively up until the given
depth, inheriting the parent options. Can be `Infinity`.

### `depthFilter`
- Default: `Filter.objectLiteralOrArray`

Decide whether to deeply register an object covered by [`depth`](#depth).
This is useful to mitigate registering properties within *any* object (class
instances, DOM nodes, etc.) in favor of simpler objects.

Be careful when changing this, especially when there is user input involved!
Unrestricted recursion may lead to a significant overload or even an infinite
loop when (accidentally) assigning complex objects like a DOM node.

### `postSetter`
Called *after* a value has been set.

Its only argument is an event object with the following properties:
- `val`: The value that was set
- `prevVal`: The previous value
- `initial` (`boolean`): Whether this call is propagated by the initial
    registration
- `path` (`Array<string | symbol>`): Key path of the property that was set

### `setter`
- See also [Intercepting values](#intercepting-values)

Called *before* a value is set. Return `true` to discard the value, i.e. to stop
the default action of setting the value to the underlying endpoint.

Its only argument is an event object with the following properties:
- `val`: The value that will be set (unless discarded)
- `prevVal`: The previous value
- `initial` (`boolean`): Whether this call is propagated by the initial
    registration
- `path` (`Array<string | symbol>`): Key path of the property that was set
- `set` (`(val) => void`): Default setter that sets a given value to the
    underlying endpoint. When using it, you should prevent the default value
    from being set by returning `true`.

### `getter`
- See also [Intercepting values](#intercepting-values)

Called anytime a value is fetched. Return `null` or `undefined` to propagate the
default value. Any other return value will be the property's value.

As inferred in [Concepts](#concepts), deep properties require a lot of `getter`
calls, so when using depth extensively, you should probably keep inherited
getter functions lightweight.

Its only argument is an event object with the following properties:
- `val`: The value from the underlying endpoint
- `path` (`Array<string | symbol>`): Key path of the property that was set
